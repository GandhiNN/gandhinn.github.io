## Pre-Computed Append Closures

### The Movie Cinema Analogy

The settings: A movie cinema which has several theater types/classes: "Regular", "IMAX", or "Premiere" and a ticketing booth that is served by a human / "front desk officers".

The flow: A customer come to the front desk saying the name of the movie name he/she wants to watch -> The front desk officers map the movie name with the theater it's playing at -> The front desk officers print out the ticket and stamp it with the name of the theater -> The front desk give the stamped ticket to the customer (the **hot loop**)

#### Approach 1: Type Switch (a.k.a the slow way)

Imagine a situation where for every single order, the front desk officer walks to the back office and asks:
> "Hey, this movie, is it playing at Regular, IMAX, or Premiere (theater type/class)?"

The back office checks and points to the right theater, then the front office stamps the ticket with the correct theater placement, then he/she goes back to his/her desk. Repeats for every single customer.

With 1000 customers x 3 theater types/classes that's 3000 times the front office asks "where does this film play?"

#### Approach 2: Pre-computed Closures (a.k.a the fast way)

Now imagine the same situation, but now the front desk officer has a cheat sheet of where each film is exactly playing:
> "The Odyssey always plays at IMAX, Spiderman is playing at Premiere, and Evil Dead is playing at Regular..."

Now, when serving the customers, the front desk officers does not need to ask anyone, he/she just looks at this cheat sheet and directly stamps the ticket with the correct theater type/class. He/she spent less time questioning, waiting, and thinking.

In this case, the cheat sheet is the **closure**. It has the answer ("film A is playing in IMAX, film B is playing in Premiere, etc") at "setup time", so the hot loop never has to figure it out again, saving a lot of time in the process.

### Why does this matter?

Imagine a scenario where you have to do ETL of raw data from an MS-SQL server and save the result sets into Parquet files. Having the cheat sheet will help the computation process ("this column is an int: use the int builder, this column is a string: use the string builder") at ETL setup time so the hot loop (ingest raw data -> casting types into proper Arrow types -> save to disk as Parquet files) never has to figure the type mapping again.

To create this cheat sheet, we can run a query to probe the schema once in the beginning of the ETL phase (i.e. executing query `SELECT TOP 0 * FROM (<table_name>) AS _probe` in MS-SQL and parse the result set into type mapping)

This means improved performance: CPU is the main actor on this process. CPUs work like an assembly line, they start processing the next instruction before the current one finishes (pipelining). But when they hit a decision point ("which type is this?"), they have to guess which path to take. If they guess wrong, they throw away the work and start over (pipeline stall).

- When using the **Type switch** approach: The decision changes every column (int, string, float, int, string...). The CPU guesses wrong more often -> more pipeline stalls.
- When using the **Pre-Computed Closures** approach: The only decision is checking whether the cell is null, and the answer most likely is "no". The CPU guesses correctly more often -> the pipeline is flowing smoother.

                row.append(random.random() * 1000)

    return builders


# APPROACH 2: Pre-Computed Closures


def build_appenders(col_types):
    """Resolve type ONCE, return a list of callables."""
    builders = []
    appenders = []

# Main

if __name__ == "__main__":

    )

    # Approach 1
    start = time.perf_counter()
    ingest_with_dispatch(rows, COL_TYPES)
    dispatch_dur = time.perf_counter() - start

    # Approach 2
    builders, appenders = build_appenders(COL_TYPES)
    start = time.perf_counter()
    ingest_with_closures(rows, appenders)
    closure_dur = time.perf_counter() - start

    cells = NUM_ROWS * NUM_COLS

    )
    print(
        f"Pre-bound methods: {closure_dur:.3f}s ({cells / closure_dur:,.0f} cells/sec)"
    )
    print(f"Speedup: {dispatch_dur / closure_dur:.2f}x")
{% endhighlight %}

This is the output of the above code when running in my local:

```bash
$ python main.py 
Generating 5M cells (500000 rows x 10 cols)...

if/elif dispatch: 0.590s (8,468,672 cells/sec)
Pre-bound methods: 0.497s (10,059,516 cells/sec)
Speedup: 1.19x
```

As you see, there's a modest speedup which I think is mostly due to Python's interpreter overhead i.e. both approaches still go through the same slow interpreter loop. The closure approach removes some dict lookups and string comparisons but they are still a small fraction of the total cost.

But imagine what will happen if we use compiled language such as Go or Rust. I guess the improvements will be much more dramatic because of the optimizations that might be done by the compiler.
