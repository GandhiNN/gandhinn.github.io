Hi! I am Gandhi. I am an engineer with 13+ years of experiences in IT industry, and an aspiring computer scientist and financial engineer.

I consider myself vendor agnostic and I am a keen cutting edge and open-source technologies practitioner. 

Many people think of me as highly proficient with IT infrastructure, mobile networking, system administration, and data platform / integration. 

I like to go low but also very capable to go high.
